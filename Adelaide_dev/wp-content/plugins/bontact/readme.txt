== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What’s included in your free version? =
A free version contains 1 chat representative, 10 minutes of call time, and 10 text messages. If you need more, check here for our pricing page. 

= Do you have a demo version? =
Yes! Check out this <a href="http://demo-bontact.ucoz.com/">demo site</a> with our widget that’s connected to a  <a href="https://dashboard.bontact.com/html/login.aspx?username=demo@bontact.com&pass=demo">demo dashboard</a> . Feel free to play around with both simultaneously to test out our features. 

= How can I support my international users? =
All of our services are offered locally and globally. We support most languages (chat) and offer calls to any destination in the world (callback/text messaging).

= How are you different than all other chat and support solutions? =
Solutions in this market are fragmented and don’t fully address the breadth of communication options. Bontact is the only solution that offers a multi-channel, online communication platform that allows you to manage your interactions easily and intelligently. 

= What is Callback? =
Bontact allows users to call your representatives directly through your site for free, no matter where they are in the world. Every callback results in two calls – one to the web visitor and another one to you. We use normal PSTN Lines (NOT VoIP) to maintain a high quality of voice call and fast connection.

= What happens if all my incoming lines are busy? =
Customers will hear a message that informs them that you are unavailable to take their call. Their details will be logged in your dashboard and you can get back to them when you can.

= Why is your callback feature a better option than a toll free number? =
Toll free numbers are more costly and require a hardware setup. This isn’t ideal for smaller companies. Callback is a hassle-free and cost-effective solution for both you and your visitors.
