Welcome!
Asha,

Thank you for choosing A2 Hosting. We appreciate your business!

Your new account has been created and should be ready in about 30 minutes. If after 30 minutes it is still not available, please open a ticket through My A2 Hosting.

You can Reboot, Shutdown, Boot and Login to cPanel from your My A2 Hosting client area by going to the Services menu, clicking My Services and then clicking Manage for your Managed VPS.

IMPORTANT: You will need to update your Nameservers for the domain you wish to use with this account. If you have registered your Domain with us you can update to the Nameservers listed below by logging in to My A2 Hosting and going to My Domains, clicking on Manage for the domain in question and then updating your Nameservers. If you have registered your domain elsewhere you will need to update the nameserver entries for that domain independently.

Your cPanel password is set to the password you chose during the order process. You can log into cPanel and review your login credentials by clicking Manage next to the package in Services -> My Services section of My A2 Hosting.

Please note that any additional email accounts created will need to use the format 'username@server.therexportal.com' as their Webmail login name. Do not rely on the default cPanel username for email, you need to create a full email account in addition to the default cpanel account. This is done in the 'Email' section of the cPanel interface.
